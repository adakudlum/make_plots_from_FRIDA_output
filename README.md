This repository holds a collection of R scripts that were used to make plots in the bird's eye paper and D3.5.

## Data
The scripts provided here take inputs from the FRIDA uncertainty sampling, which has to be obtained prior to running these scripts. The script _plot_comparison_FRIDA_and_different_IAMs_, which compares FRIDA's endogenous behaviour with different Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), additionally requires a set of data (provided with the repo). These were obtained from the SSP database hosted by IIASA (<a href="#">https://tntcat.iiasa.ac.at/SspDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&page=about</a>)

## R packages required
